Carbon Assessment - Tracking Package

A logistics company has contracted you to build a service that will be used to track packages. Possible package statuses are PICKED_UP, IN_TRANSIT, WAREHOUSE, DELIVERED. It’s possible for a package to be IN_TRANSIT, and WAREHOUSE multiple times but it’s not possible to be PICKED_UP and DELIVERED more than once.

Build a service to cater this requirement as started by the logistics company. You are free to decide what endpoints your service will have and how they will work.
